#Practial Machine Learning Project

##Introduction
Using the data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm and dumbell of 6 participants, in addition to the classification of activity quality, develop a model which can be used to predict activity quality given only the accelerometer data.  For more information and the data source, see here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har .

##How the Model was Built
Libraries are loaded:
```
library(knitr)
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
library(caret)
#library(rpart.plot)
library(randomForest)
```

Data is read in:
```
TrainingData <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
TestingData <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")

dim(TrainingData)
dim(TestingData)
```
